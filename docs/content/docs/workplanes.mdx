# Workplanes

Workplanes are fundamental to creating 2D sketches and 3D geometry in RapidCADpy. They define a coordinate system where you can draw shapes and perform operations like extrude and revolve.

## Creating Standard Workplanes

The simplest way to create a workplane is using one of the standard planes (XY, XZ, or YZ):

```python
from rapidcadpy import InventorApp

app = InventorApp()
app.new_document()

# Create a workplane on the XY plane
wp_xy = app.work_plane("XY")

# Create a workplane on the XZ plane
wp_xz = app.work_plane("XZ")

# Create a workplane on the YZ plane
wp_yz = app.work_plane("YZ")
```

## Creating Offset Workplanes

You can create a workplane that is offset from one of the standard planes:

```python
from rapidcadpy import InventorApp

app = InventorApp()
app.new_document()

# Create a workplane 5 units above the XY plane
wp = app.work_plane("XY", offset=5.0)

# Create a workplane 10 units in front of the XZ plane
wp = app.work_plane("XZ", offset=10.0)

# Create a workplane -3 units from the YZ plane (negative offset)
wp = app.work_plane("YZ", offset=-3.0)
```

Currently support for the Inventor Integration.
