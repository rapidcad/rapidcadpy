# Inventor Reverse Engineering

RapidCADpy provides a powerful reverse engineering tool for Autodesk Inventor IPT files. This feature allows you to automatically generate Python code that recreates the geometry and features found in an Inventor part file.

## What does it do?
- Loads an IPT file using the Inventor COM API
- Analyzes sketches, extrudes, and revolves
- Generates readable Python code using the RapidCADpy fluent API

## Example Usage

```python
from rapidcadpy.integrations.inventor.app import InventorApp
from rapidcadpy.integrations.inventor.reverse_engineer import InventorReverseEngineer

def reverse_engineer_ipt(file_path: str) -> str:
    app = InventorApp()
    doc = app.open_document(file_path)
    engineer = InventorReverseEngineer(doc)
    generated_code = engineer.analyze_ipt_file()
    return generated_code

# Example: Reverse engineer a cube IPT file
code = reverse_engineer_ipt("C:/path/to/test_cube_10x10x10.ipt")
print(code)
```

## What does the generated code look like?

The output will be Python code that uses the RapidCADpy Inventor backend:

```python
from rapidcadpy.integrations.inventor import InventorApp

# Initialize Inventor application
app = InventorApp()
app.new_document()

# Sketch 1
wp1 = app.work_plane("XY")
wp1.move_to(0.0, 0.0).line_to(10.0, 0.0).line_to(10.0, 10.0).line_to(0.0, 10.0).line_to(0.0, 0.0)

# Extrude feature 1
shape1 = wp1.extrude(10.0, 'NewBodyFeatureOperation')
```


## Supported Features
- Sketches (lines, arcs, circles)
- Extrude features
- Revolve features
- Base planes and custom workplanes

## Limitations
- Only supports IPT part files
- Axis for revolve is currently simplified (origin of sketch)
- More advanced features (patterns, fillets, etc.) are not yet supported

## Advanced: Customizing the Output
You can extend the `InventorReverseEngineer` class to support more features or customize the generated code format. See the source in `rapidcadpy/integrations/inventor/reverse_engineer.py` for details.
