# App
Is the virtual equivalent of a CAD application. Workplanes can be created in the app.

# Workplane
Used to create and manipulate geometry. It contains functions like `extrude`, `line_to`, `circle`, etc.
Extrude returns a new `Shape` object.

<PyFunction name={"extrude"}>
    <PyParameter name={"distance"} type={"float"}/>
    <PyFunctionReturn type={"Shape"} />
</PyFunction>

# Shape
Represents a 3D shape. Supports `union`.
