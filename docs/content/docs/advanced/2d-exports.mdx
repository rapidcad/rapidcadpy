# PNG Rendering Feature

## Overview

RapidCADpy provides PNG rendering capabilities for the OCC backend with two distinct methods:

1. **`to_png()`** - Technical drawings using Hidden Line Removal (HLR)

## Quick Start

### Technical Drawing (HLR)
```python
shape.to_png("output.png", "Z")  # Top view, technical drawing
```

### 3D Rendered Image
```python
shape.to_png_rendered("output.png", "iso")  # Isometric view, shaded
```

Uses OpenCascade's Hidden Line Removal algorithm for engineering-style orthographic projections.

### Usage

```python
from rapidcadpy.integrations.occ.app import OpenCascadeApp

app = OpenCascadeApp()
wp = app.work_plane("XY")

# Create a shape
shape = wp.rect(10, 10).extrude(5)

# Render from different views
shape.to_png("output_x.png", "X")  # Right view (YZ plane)
shape.to_png("output_y.png", "Y")  # Front view (XZ plane)
shape.to_png("output_z.png", "Z")  # Top view (XY plane)
```

### Method Signature

```python
def to_png(self, file_name: str, view: str = "X") -> None:
    """
    Render the shape to a PNG file from a specified camera angle.

    Args:
        file_name: Path to save the PNG file
        view: Camera view direction - "X", "Y", or "Z" (default: "X")
             - "X": Looking along X-axis (YZ plane view, similar to RIGHT view)
             - "Y": Looking along Y-axis (XZ plane view, similar to FRONT view)
             - "Z": Looking along Z-axis (XY plane view, similar to TOP view)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If view is not one of "X", "Y", or "Z"
    """
```


### Backends

The method tries backends in this order (unless specified):

1. **pyvista** (Recommended - fast, simple, and lightweight)
   ```bash
   pip install pyvista
   ```

2. **vedo** (Feature-rich, scientific viz)
   ```bash
   pip install vedo
   ```

**Backend Selection:**
- `backend="auto"` - Try pyvista → vedo (default)
- `backend="pyvista"` - Use pyvista only (fastest)
- `backend="vedo"` - Use vedo only

### View Options

| View Name | Aliases | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| "iso" | "isometric" | 3D isometric view (45° angles) |
| "front" | "Y" | Front view (looking along Y-axis) |
| "top" | "Z" | Top view (looking down Z-axis) |
| "right" | "X" | Right view (looking along X-axis) |

## View Directions

| View | Direction Vector | What You See | Similar To |
|------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| "X"  | (1, 0, 0)       | YZ plane     | Right view |
| "Y"  | (0, 1, 0)       | XZ plane     | Front view |
| "Z"  | (0, 0, 1)       | XY plane     | Top view   |

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/test_integrations/test_fluent_api_occ.py::TestFluentAPIOCCBackend::test_to_png_rendering
```

Or run the example script:
```bash
python example_png_rendering.py
```
