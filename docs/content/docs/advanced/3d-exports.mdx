# 3D Export Formats
RapidCADpy supports exporting 3D models to several standard formats, including:
- **STEP (.step, .stp)** - Standard for the Exchange of Product model data
- **STL (.stl)** - Stereolithography format for 3D printing
- **IPT (.ipt)** - Autodesk Inventor Part file

Exports functions are available on objects inheriting from 'Shape'.

## Exporting to STEP

```python
shape.export("model.step")
# alternative
shape.to_step("model.step")
```

## Exporting to STL

```python
shape.export("model.stl")
# alternative
shape.to_stl("model.stl")
```
