# App
Is the virtual equivalent of a CAD application. Workplanes can be created in the app.

# Workplane
Used to create and manipulate geometry. It contains functions like `extrude`, `line_to`, `circle`, etc.
Extrude returns a new `Shape` object.

<PythonFunction
    name="extrude"
    signature="extrude(distance: float) -> Shape"
    description="Extrude the active sketch by a distance and return a new 3D shape."
    params={{
        distance: {
            type: 'float',
            description: 'Extrusion distance.',
            required: true,
        },
    }}
    returns={{
        type: 'Shape',
        description: 'The newly created 3D shape.',
    }}
/>

# Shape
Represents a 3D shape. Supports `union`.
